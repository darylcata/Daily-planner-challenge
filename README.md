# Daily Planner Challenge

## Your Task

Our task was to create a daily planner during work hours. In this challenge I did 9AM -5PM. The page will display a red background on the timeblock that corresponds with the current time. If the time block is in the past it will show a grey color, and if in future will show green. Whenever the user enters a task on the textarea, it will be saved to local storage after clicking the save button and will persists even when the webpage reloads or refreshes.

## Usage

This webpage can be used to keep track of your day to day duties or tasks. When the page loads up it will tell you the current date. Type in the tasks that needs to be done depending on what time and even if you close the page the task entered persists.

## Mock-Up

In this mock-up, I have set the current time to be 12PM.
